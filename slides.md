# Open Space

- Learn what you want to learn 💡
- Connect with people 👯
- Make the most of it (without trying too hard!) 🏁

---

# Four guiding principles

1. Whoever comes is the right group
2. Whenever it starts is the right time
3. Whatever happens is the only thing that can happen. **Be prepared to be surprised!**
4. When it's over it's over

--- 

# Just one law

## The law of two feet 

Not contributing / Not learning --> Use your two feet 🐾 and go somewhere else

---

# Roles

- Participants 🧍🧍‍♂🧍‍♀
- Bumblebees 🐝
- Butterflies 🦋

---

# Logistics

- Post-it notes + pens to propose topics
- Conversation areas properly identified

--- 

# Group Dynamics

1. Opening
2. Topics
3. **Open Space** - Rounds 1, 2 and 3
4. Closing Circle

---

# Opening - explained

- The overall theme is set
- Some boundaries are set to help focus

---

# Topics - explained

- The topic proposals form the agenda (the menu)
- Topic structure
  - Short description
  - Name of the person proposing the topic 
- Topics need:
  - Initiative, not necessarily experts (Think: "conversation")
  - Someone to record the gist of the meeting (might be the same person who made the proposal)
- We might want to combination of topics
- We might want to move the topics across time and space
